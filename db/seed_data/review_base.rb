  "It was much better than I expected. The decor was unique and incredible. Everything was mostly decadent. Make sure to save room for dessert, because that was the best part of the meal! 4 stars of quality."

    "Best experience ever! I want to hire their decorator to furnish my apartment. This was one of the best mouth-watering burgers I've had grace my taste buds in a long time. After my meal, I was knocked into a food coma. The appetizers must be sprinkled with crack because I just craved for more and more. Overall experience: 5 stars."

    "Lame. The ambiance gives off an earthy feel-good vibe. The service wasn't that good and the waiter was rude. I shouldn't have to pay good money to be served vegetables from a can. I felt the prices were too high given the quality of the food. 2 stars."

    "I felt like this place wasn't trying hard enough. There were bits of food stuck to my silverware. The steak was under-seasoned. Overhyped. They need to get their act together before I set foot in this place again."

    "This place was just ok. The tofu dish tasted spongy and a bit bland. Seriously, how difficult is it to get a clean glass around here? Everything tasted either microwaved or straight from a can. The whole place was just dirty. They need to get their act together before I set foot in this place again."

    "Dreadful place. The ambiance gives off an earthy feel-good vibe. The menu didn't match the one on their website. I heard a rumor that the vegetarian dishes are prepared alongside the meat. I shouldn't have to pay good money to be served vegetables from a can. They need to get their act together before I set foot in this place again."

    "I can summarize my visit in one word: Horrendous. The kitchen screwed up my order completely, mixing it up with someone else's. It took almost an hour to get it corrected! This place is very dumpy and in a serious need of a makeover. I wish I could put a sign out front that said 'BEWARE OF DOG (FOOD)!'"

    "This place is a waste of real estate. Even Chef Boyardee would be disgusted by this sorry attempt at a meal. I think this place was featured on Kitchen Nightmares, or at least it should have been. This food will start the zombie apocalypse. Stay away!"

    "No, no, no, a million times no! I heard a rumor that the vegetarian dishes are prepared alongside the meat. I threw up in my mouth a little when they brought me my food. The center of my steak was so frozen it started singing 'Let It Go.' The kitchen screwed up my order completely, mixing it up with someone else's. It took almost an hour to get it corrected! Wild horses couldn't drag me back here."
